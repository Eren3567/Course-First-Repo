# Enum Example: Application Levels

This program demonstrates the use of enums in C to represent different application levels. It defines three levels: low, medium, and high, each with a corresponding numeric value.

__Features__

- Enum Definition: Defines three application levels using the `enum` keyword.
- Value Assignment: Assigns integer values to each enum member.
- Enum Initialization: Initializes a variable with one of the enum values.

## Usage

The program initializes a variable `uygulamasi` with the value corresponding to the "medium" level (`orta`). It then prints the numeric value associated with the "medium" level.
